        <p>There were only the stars… the stars and this absolutely gigantic space dragon clomped in the middle of them. For so long the dragon slept that his dreams had started to take physical forms of their own. Soon planets started taking shape around him, their surfaces flooded with sweet water and falling stars creating their shape. 
            Then came the animals who grew from the virgin trees like ripe fruit and the birds who fell from the rings of distant planets. Following them from the residue of space dust were the insects and everything too small for any eye to see. Then one day, a little worm wriggled out from the soil. But it was not a worm, no, it was a finger. Day by day it laboriously struggled and squirmed its way out from its dirt prison until finally, one day, the first human emerged. And they would not be the last. 
        </p>
        <p>After them more and more humans emerged. Some were constricted by rocks to be long and thin, some round and soft like the vegetables entwined with them, some solid and sturdy like the roots of a tree, and so on and on they grew. Over time these humans came together and learned how to survive on the rock they called home. Wars were fought and won, civilizations came and went, babies were born, the elderly passed on their legacies, and everyone had all but forgotten about their creator.
        <p>The space dragon snored on and on and still more and more wondrous things were created from his mind. But the more he dreamt, the more power he lost and he became smaller and smaller. The very planets he used to dwarf had begun to dwarf him and he had finally shrunk down to the size of a small mountain. And it was there, in the shade of the world’s first forest with the soft dewy grass tickling his gigantic nostrils and the sweet songs of birds beckoning his ears, the dragon awoke. </p>
        <p>
        Eyes as bright as the moon opened and observed its surroundings. The sun was warm and the water clean, the animals were plentiful and the fruit was ripe. The dragon saw a kingdom far off in the distance and carefully watched the humans it once dreamt of laughing and working through their daily chores. The housewives chatted and gossiped while their husbands guffawed at bars and slapped each others’ backs in mirth, the children running by giggling at their games.
        </p>
        <p>
        And the dragon looked on. Should he have felt the pride of creation? The warm happiness in the chest that comes with observing others’ joy? No. It felt Rage. “How dare these puny worms suck him of all his power?!”, he thought. “Just to laugh like fools all day, destined to die in the margins of history and doomed to never make a single miniscule mark in the universe?!”
        </p>
        <p>
            And so the dragon decided to destroy it all. Doing so would take his power back and restore him to his former fearsome glory and he could start all over again. The flowery meadows burnt to a crisp and the rivers dried to dust. The blood of animals ran in their place and the sky went dark with the smoke of destruction as the dragon began its violent rampage. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Distraught at the carnage, the King of the kingdom summoned his best knight and asked her to kill the dragon and promised her the support and backing of the entire kingdom. Satisfied with the deal she set out the very next day with her band of not so merry men (mind you they would have been merrier if not for the whole dragon thing).   
        </p>
        <p>
            Dear reader, I know you were expecting a happy ending to this story, but the reality of the matter is that by this time the dragon had already regained enough of its power to regrow into the size of Mt. Everest. But still on and on the battle wore on. The knight’s merry men had all fallen early on in the fight, but everytime one of them fell a legion would take their place. For not only was the entire kingdom’s army at her back, but upon hearing about the scourge of the dragon, other kingdom’s around the world had sent their armies to help in taking down the beast. The battle was long fought and bloody, but at last the beast let out one last roar of anger and defeat as the sword of the knight carved its heart out of its cavernous chest.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet it was too late. As the knight’s sword fell from her hands so too did her body follow. And there would never be anyone to follow after her for she was the last human on all the earth. The flames of the creation beast burned long and hard scouring the planet in one last funeral pyre. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And yet not all was lost. Miraculously, among all the fire a single branch from the earth’s very first tree managed to stay intact. It remained long after the fires were finally doused by healing rains and it remained long after those had gone out too. On and on it remained as grass regrew around it and new trees formed. Mountains lifted it high into the air and gales blew it all around the healing earth. Animals brushed it by and birds snatched it for their nests. Until finally, a new human picked it up and took it home. And there it finally saw fit to bloom a singular beautiful flower and lived out the rest of its days as the pencil I’m writing this story with.

            Oh.. it broke.
